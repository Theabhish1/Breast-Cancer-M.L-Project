BREAST CANCER PROJECT

It is Machine learning based project which is made on Google Colab.In this, basically we are making model which can predict whether someone is suffering from Breast cancer or not.
If Diagnosis is 1= Malignant (Cancerous) - Present
If Diagnosis is 0= Benign (Not Cancerous) -Absent

Operation we performed in this project:-
1.Loading the data into python
2.Performing EDA 
3.Training the data by a classification model
4.Making the predictions for a single test record  

Libraries used in this project:-
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn 
sklearn

## classification models used in this
Logistic regression,SVM,naive bayes,Random forest,xg boost

## xg boost and Random forest  had given us highest accuracy

We used classification mo
